# UsingSPMFromCPDemo
A basic Cocoapods demo project to show how to use SwiftPM products from Cocoapods development pods.

This is divided in three states:
- Starter: the original project without SPM package (only using Cocoapods internal libraries)
- Final: the solved version with both Package managers sharing a common swift module.
- Challenge: an intermediate state with the dependency only in SPM package.

The article will be shared here later.
